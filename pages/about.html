            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p id ="about-me-paragraph">Hi! My name is Mark Dormeus and I'm currently a rising Junior at FSU and I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science alongside 
                a double minor in IT and English. I'm of primarily Haitian origin, but Martinican as well although by Kr√®yol is subpar.

            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I'm interested in becoming a penetration tester and so in my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with tools 
                such as Wireshark, Metasploit, and Hashcat with Kali Linux and Parrot OS. When I'm not focused on any of my aforementioned interests, I focus 
                on game development, whether that be working on projects in Unreal Engine or reverse engineering pre-existing games. I'm currently looking for 
                DevSecOps, SysAdmin, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, or Cybersecurity internships.
